# AtlantbhSmokeTest
QA Application: Manual Testing and Test Automation

Welcome to my project! In this assignment, I was tasked with creating test cases for a shopping page, focusing on real user flows, and identifying what represented a smoke test. Using the Selenium testing framework and Java programming language, I automated the smoke test and created a comprehensive Readme file to document the process. This project aims to showcase my skills in automated testing, particularly using Selenium and Java.
